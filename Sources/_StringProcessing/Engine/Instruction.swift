 This is in need of more refactoring and design, the following
 are a rough listing of TODOs:

 - Save point and call stack interactions should be more formalized.
 - It's too easy to have unbalanced save/clears amongst function calls
 - Nominal type for conditions with an invert bit
 - Better bit allocation and layout for operand, instruction, etc
 - Use spare bits for better assertions
 - Check low-level compiler code gen for switches
 - Consider relative addresses instead of absolute addresses
 - Explore a predication bit
 - Explore using SIMD
 - Explore a larger opcode, so that we can have variant flags
   - E.g., opcode-local bits instead of flattening opcode space

 We'd like to eventually design:

 - A general-purpose core (future extensibility)
 - A matching-specific instruction area carved out
 - Leave a large area for future usage of run-time bytecode interpretation
 - Debate: allow for future variable-width instructions

 We'd like a testing / performance setup that lets us

 - Define new instructions in terms of old ones (testing, perf)
 - Version our instruction set in case we need future fixes
